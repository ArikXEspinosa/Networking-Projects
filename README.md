# Networking-Projects
The following projects demonstrating practical knowledge of networking skills 
- School District Network Simulation (Cisco Packet Tracer)
  I built a network for a school district using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network connects different buildings like admin, student labs, and classrooms. I set up routers, switches, VLANs, DHCP, NAT, and used a method called "Router-on-a-Stick" to let VLANs talk to each other.
Tools & Skills Used:

Cisco Packet Tracer

VLANs (to separate devices into groups)

Trunking (to allow VLAN traffic between switches)

Router-on-a-Stick (so VLANs can talk to each other)

DHCP (to give devices IP addresses automatically)

NAT (to give internet access)

Routing and IP addressing
