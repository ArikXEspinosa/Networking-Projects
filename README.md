# Networking-Projects
The following projects demonstrating practical knowledge of networking skills.
Project Overview
- School District Network Simulation (Cisco Packet Tracer)
  I built a network for a school district using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network connects different buildings like admin, student labs, and classrooms. I set up routers, switches, VLANs, DHCP, NAT, and used a method called "Router-on-a-Stick" to let VLANs talk to each other.
  
Tools & Skills Used:

-Cisco Packet Tracer
-VLANs (to separate devices into groups)

-Trunking (to allow VLAN traffic between switches)

-Router-on-a-Stick (so VLANs can talk to each other)

-DHCP (to give devices IP addresses automatically)

-NAT (to give internet access)

-Routing and IP addressing

  
 What I Learned:
 
-How to set up and connect a full network

-How VLANs help organize and secure traffic

-How to set up DHCP and NAT

-How to let VLANs talk to each other

-How to fix problems when the network doesnâ€™t work right

Challenges I Faced:

NAT wasnt't giving internet access until I fixed the access list
Some devices weren't connecting because of port issues.
Vlans didnt work because the trunk ports weren't set up

Project Overview 
- DNS and Domain Simulation (Cisco Packet Tracer)
  I created a network simulation to mimic how a DNS server and domain work together. This involved setting up a DNS server to resolve domain names for client PCs and configuring client devices to join the domain, simulating a real-world corporate or school network environment.

  Tools & Skills Used:

Cisco Packet Tracer

-
DNS Server Configuration

-Domain Name Setup

-Client Domain Join Simulation

-IP Addressing and Network Configuration

What I Learned:

-How to set up and configure a DNS server

-How domain names resolve to IP addresses

-How to simulate domain join process on client PCs

-How to troubleshoot DNS and domain issues

Challenges I Faced:

Ensuring correct DNS records for domain resolution
Configuring client PCs to properly register with the domain
Simulating domain join in Packet Tracer without full Active Directory support
