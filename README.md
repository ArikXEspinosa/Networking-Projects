# Networking-Projects
The following projects demonstrating practical knowledge of networking skills.
Project Overview
- School District Network Simulation (Cisco Packet Tracer)
  I built a network for a school district using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network connects different buildings like admin, student labs, and classrooms. I set up routers, switches, VLANs, DHCP, NAT, and used a method called "Router-on-a-Stick" to let VLANs talk to each other.
  
Tools & Skills Used:
Cisco Packet Tracer
VLANs (to separate devices into groups)
Trunking (to allow VLAN traffic between switches)
Router-on-a-Stick (so VLANs can talk to each other)
DHCP (to give devices IP addresses automatically)
NAT (to give internet access)
Routing and IP addressing
  
 What I Learned:
How to set up and connect a full network
How VLANs help organize and secure traffic
How to set up DHCP and NAT
How to let VLANs talk to each other
How to fix problems when the network doesnâ€™t work right

Challenges I Faced:
NAT wasnt't giving internet access until I fixed the access list
Some devices weren't connecting because of port issues.
Vlans didnt work because the trunk ports weren't set up
